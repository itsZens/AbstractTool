# AbstractTool
Tool to analyze a plain text file located on a folder called "AbstractTool" created by the program. It returns:
  - Name of the file
  - Extension of the file
  - Creation date
  - Last modification date
  - Theme of the file (Top 5 more repeated words in the text)


The folder "AbstractTool" is created by default on the user's desktop. Inside, you must place the file called "InvalidWords.txt" where are placed all the words that the tool has to ignore (articles, prepositions, adverbs...). 

AbstractTool can only analyze correctly files written in catalan. In order to analyze files written in other languages, place the words that AbstracTool should not count in the "InvalidWords.txt". Some words that should ignore are articles, prepositions, adverbs...
